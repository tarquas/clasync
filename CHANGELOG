*** Version 0.2.0 - 2018-09-07

Functional (static/func.js):
- More isolation with private fields;
- Remove filtered items from array and return them in new array: `$.remove()`.

Events (emmiter.js):
- Multiple event handling stages (handler rank is identified by a numerical value);
- Event handler results are merged into one object and event is
  treated as handled on current stage if this object is not empty;
- Any-handlers -- if not handled by some target handler, emit to any-handler.

MQ Discovery (mq/discovery.js):
- Ensure that list of instances will contain own instance ASAP.

Web (web/index.js):
- Ability to manually confirm on web server readiness for binding.

Main module (index.js; static/main.js):
- Immediately terminate application after graceful shutdown time elapsed;
- Immediately terminate application on double user-terminating signals (f.x. Ctrl+C).

*** Version 0.3.2 - 2018-11-01

MQ Mongo-based (mq/mongo/):
- Support queue priority (records with lower priorities are processed first);
- Support queue topic (only one from several records that have the same topic are guaranteed to be processed at a moment).
- Support important queue records (in case of clean exit, finalizer will wait within graceful shutdown period for such tasks to finish).
- Reduced default visibility timeout (from 3 minutes to 1 minute).
- Periodically wake up workers (in visibility timeout period) to check for records which had been possibly stalled after crash.

MQ Discovery (mq/discovery.js):
- Retry after unsuccessful attempt to signal instance up event for keep-alive (caused by connection loss etc.).

*** Version 0.3.3 - 2019-01-31

Main module / error logging (index.js):
- Static dollar support (circular): `ClasyncClass.$ = ClasyncClass`.

Main module / error logging (index.js; static/error.js):
- Logging wrappers: `$.log`, `$.logError`, `$.logFatal`, `$.logDebug`.

*** Version 0.3.8 - 2019-04-05

Cache (cache.js):
- Support unlimited values for maxCount and maxLifetime. 

MQ Mongo-based (mq/mongo/):
- Delay before retrying sync on too big network latency detected;
- Fix topic race condition detection bug;
- Apply deprecations of `mongoose`.

Functional (static/func.js):
- Support multiple key grouping of `groupBy` if grouping function/map returns array.

*** Version 0.3.10 - 2019-04-15

Main module (index.js; static/main.js):
- Add `afterInit()` and `beforeFinal()`;
- Add `initFatal()`;
- Add `mainFatal()`.

Main module / error logging (index.js; static/error.js):
- Minor bugfixes.

Functional (static/func.js):
- Add `$.firstKey()`, `$.firstValue()`, `$.firstEntry()`;
- Add `$.regExpInput()`.

*** Version 0.3.11 - 2019-05-24

Functional (static/func.js):
- Make `$.makeObject()` use null-prototype object as a base.

MQ Dispatcher (mq/disp.js):
- Register inline workers in `$.afterInit()`.

MQ Mongo-based (mq/mongo/):
- Do not try to signal queue if queue item is lost;
- Set default remote to local time sync retries to 3.

Web (web/rest.js):
- Register inline routes in `afterInit()`. 

*** Version 0.4.0 - 2019-06-19

Overall
- Prefer `$.makeObject()` for creating dictionaries.

MQ Dispatcher (mq/disp.js):
- Support multiple handlers of the same inline worker as `N*TYPE name`, f.x. `4*WORKER processUsers`.

*** Version 0.5.1 - 2019-08-07

Overall
- Add all classes to tree under base class, f.x. `require('clasync').Web` is same as `require('clasync/web')`.

Functional (static/func.js):
- Add mappings: `$.null`, `$.bound`;
- Add reducing: `$.min`, `$.max`.

Workers and Threads (worker/*; thread/*):
- Add own classes for `'cluster'` (`$.Worker`) and `'worker_threads'` (`$.Thread`).

*** Version 0.6.2 - 2019-08-17

MQ Mongo-based (mq/mongo/):
- Add `queue:sleep` pubsub event when queue runs out of active tasks;
- Add `at`, `in` options for `.push()`;
- Add `expires`, `ttl` options for `.push()`;
- Add `.push()` options support to `.rpc()`;
- Remove `queueEventName`. Add `queuePfx`, `newTaskEvent`, `sleepEvent`;
- Per-instance `visibilityMsec` value;
- Verbose `queue:newTask` pubsub events.

MQ Dispatcher (mq/disp.js):
- Add options support to `.push()` and `.rpc()` wrappers.

Main module (index.js; static/main.js):
- Add `$.App`;
- Add flexible `configure`;
- Fatal error if main module class is `Clasync` itself;
- Fix bug with `.exit()`.

Main module / error logging (index.js; static/error.js):
- Add support for DEBUG env var: `$.getDebug`, `$.logDebug`.

Functional (static/func.js):
- `$.all()` and `$.race()` now accept promises in multiple arguments (gets flattened).
